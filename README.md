🎧 Audible Data Cleaning & Analysis Project
This project focuses on performing data cleaning and standardization on an Audible dataset using Microsoft Excel's Power Query Editor to prepare it for meaningful business analysis.

The goal was to transform raw, inconsistent data into a structured, clean, and accurate format, ensuring all fields are correctly typed and uniformly presented for reliable insights. 

🎯 Project Objectives
Prepare raw Audible dataset for insightful analysis using Excel tools. 

Standardize inconsistent data formats across multiple columns (Name, Author, Date, Time, Price, Stars). 

Convert text-based values (ratings, time) into appropriate numeric and duration formats. 

Split complex, multi-value fields (multiple authors, narrators) into separate columns for clarity. 

Create new, combined fields to enhance data readability and usability. 

🛠️ Tools Used

Microsoft Excel: Power Query, Pivot Tables, Formulas, Charts. 



✨ New Field Creation
A new field, Released Info, was created to combine the release date and language columns for easier data consumption. 


Formula Logic: Concatenated the formatted releasedate (DD-MM-YYYY) and the language column. 


Final Format Example: DD-MM-YYYY English (e.g., 04-08-2008 English). 

✅ Conclusion
The dataset is now structured, consistent, and ready for further business analysis, ensuring reliable insights and supporting data-driven decision-making.
